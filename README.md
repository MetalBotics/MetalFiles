# MetalFiles vs. Discord & Google Drive for Secure File Sharing

## MetalFiles

**Purpose:** Designed specifically for secure, ephemeral file sharing (such as secrets, environment files).

**Benefits:**
- **Ephemeral Links:** Files are available for a limited time or number of downloads, then deleted automatically.
- **No Account Required:** Share files without making users register.
- **No File History:** Files are not stored long-term, reducing accidental leaks.
- **End-to-End Security:** Typically, files are encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **No Metadata Leaks:** Minimal data retained—no chat logs or collaboration history.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Tailored for secret sharing and developer workflows (e.g., sharing `.env` files, config, secrets).

## Discord

**Purpose:** Real-time chat and collaboration platform.

**Drawbacks for Sensitive Files:**
- **Persistence:** Files remain accessible in chat history unless deleted manually.
- **Not Ephemeral:** No built-in expiry or one-time-download.
- **Limited Security Controls:** Anyone with access to the channel can download files.
- **Not Designed for Secrets:** Risk of accidental leaks if channels are public or permissions are misconfigured.

## Google Drive (or similar cloud storage)

**Purpose:** General cloud file storage and collaboration.

**Drawbacks for Sensitive Files:**
- **Long-Term Storage:** Files stay until you manually remove them.
- **Link Sharing Risks:** Shared links can be forwarded, and access controls can be tricky.
- **Account Requirement:** Recipients often need a Google account.
- **Audit Trail:** File access and edits are logged (can be good or bad for privacy).
- **Not Ephemeral:** No easy way to set file expiration or one-time download.

**Bottom Line:**  
MetalFiles is purpose-built for secure, temporary transfer of sensitive files, minimizing risks and friction. Discord and Drive are better for collaboration, but not for sharing secrets or files that should disappear after use.
